# ACL Tear Detection

This is a full-stack platform built with  Next.js, TypeScript, ShadCN UI, Acertinity UI, Lucide React, and Tailwind CSS. The platform provides players with an MRI-based assessment for ACL injuries, offers personalized exercise plans for recovery, and integrates posture detection using ML to ensure proper form during exercises. Players can also book appointments with doctors for rechecking and validating progress through reports.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malikEhsan09/Frontend-ACL--Anterior_Cruciate_Ligament-.git

cd Frontend-ACL--Anterior_Cruciate_Ligament-

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

To run the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the application.

You can start editing the app by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

## ‚ú® Core Functionality

1. **MRI Upload and ACL Assessment**  
   Players can upload their MRI scans, and based on the assessment results, the system provides insights into the severity of the injury.
   
2. **Personalized Recovery Exercises**  
   Based on the MRI results, the platform recommends a personalized set of exercises designed to aid recovery from the ACL injury.

3. **Posture Detection with ML Kit**  
   Using a posture detection **ML Kit**, players can perform recovery exercises in front of their camera. The system checks and provides feedback on their posture to ensure exercises are performed correctly, reducing the risk of further injury.

4. **Doctor Consultations and Report Validation**  
   Players can book appointments with doctors to validate their progress. The platform generates detailed progress reports based on exercise performance and assessment results, which can be reviewed by doctors during consultations.

## üåü Features

- **MRI Assessment**: Players upload MRI scans, which are assessed to provide insights into ACL injuries.
- **Exercise Recommendations**: Personalized recovery exercises based on MRI results.
- **Posture Detection**: Real-time posture correction using the ML Kit.
- **Doctor Appointments**: Players can book doctor appointments to validate reports and track recovery progress.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure it works seamlessly across devices.

## üìù Usage

- **Upload MRI**: Navigate to the MRI upload section, select your MRI file, and receive an assessment of your ACL injury.
- **Exercises**: After receiving your assessment, you'll be provided with a set of exercises designed to help your recovery.
- **Posture Detection**: Perform the exercises in front of your camera, and the system will guide you with real-time feedback on your posture.
- **Doctor Consultation**: You can book an appointment with a doctor, who will review your progress and provide further recommendations.

## üìö Scripts

To help you manage the project, here are some common scripts:

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server.
